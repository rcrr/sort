Sort is a collection of algorithms for sorting data.

This work has been prepared using the CWEB System by D. E. Knuth and S. Levy.
The source CWEB files are translated into the TeX manual and the C source code
applying the CWEAVE and CTANGLE programs. Give a look to the Makefile if you
want to see how the process is carryed out.
